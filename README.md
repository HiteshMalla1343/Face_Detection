# Face_Detection

This repository contains a deep learning model that detects human faces in images and draws a boundary box around them. The model is built using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, and is implemented in Python.

The model is trained on a large dataset of human faces and uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify key facial features. Once a face is detected, the model uses object detection algorithms to draw a boundary box around the face in the image.
